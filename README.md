Performed end-to-end exploratory data analysis on 1M+ hospital discharge records using Excel, SQL, Python, and Power BI to uncover high-cost diagnoses, patient trends, and hospital profitability insights.

• Excel : Performed initial data cleaning, explored data types and added profit column for quick insights.

 • SQL : Queried 1M+ records to filter diagnoses, compute hospital-wise revenue, and segment patients
 by treatment cost.
 
 • Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib): Conducted EDA to identify top costly diseases, gender-wise
 trends, cost distributions, etc.
 
 • Power BI : Built interactive dashboard to visualize hospital performance, diagnosis cost comparison,
 regional patterns, Payment Method, etc.
